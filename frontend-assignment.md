# Neueda Frontend Assignment

## Description

Most of us are familiar with URLs like `bit.ly` or `t.co` on our Twitter or Facebook feeds.
These are examples of shortened URLs, which are a short alias or pointer to a longer page link.
For example, the shortened URL [https://bit.ly/2CarA6F](https://bit.ly/2CarA6F) will forward you to a Google URL with search results about cats.

## Mandatory Requirements

Create a frontend web application where you can submit a long URL and display the registered shorten URL.

Implement the matching backend that will persist the data and handle redirect.

## Additional Requirements

- Gather different statistics and present them in the front end
- Write tests (unit / bit / e2e) with the framework of your choice.
  Please note, this should demonstrate your ability to write tests, 100% coverage is **NOT** the target.
- Implement and document up to 5 improvements of your choice
- Use Docker / Docker compose

## Assessment

Use the web frontend technologies of your choice.

Treat this as a real project.
It should be readable, maintainable, and extensible where appropriate.
Document and comment the solution as if you will transfer it to another team, it should be clear how to work with it and what is going on.

You should send us a link to a Git repository that we will be able to clone.
